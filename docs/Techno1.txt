The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Solar: Technology, Setup, and Startup
by Mr. Sony Sabdao, RME

Introduction
On November 22, our class held the third session of our webinar series on Zoom for our Technopreneurship course under Engr. Olesco. This time, our block invited Mr. Sony Sabdao, the General Manager of S-S Enterprises. His talk, titled “The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Solar,” explored how solar energy can help tackle everyday problems in many communities, especially unstable power and rising electric bills.

Summary
Mr. Sabdao opened the discussion by connecting solar science with real-world engineering work. He explained how sunlight becomes usable energy through the photovoltaic effect and how solar setups increase in scale depending on the power requirements of a household or business. He also compared grid-tie, hybrid and off-grid systems in a very practical way, showing how each one fits different lifestyles and locations.

After laying down the technical ideas, he shifted to what it actually takes to build a solar business. He highlighted the need for accurate financial calculations, proper permits, site evaluations and a clear understanding of customer needs. Solar work might sound exciting, but according to him, progress depends on careful planning. A good design only becomes valuable when it is financially sound and properly executed.

Learnings and Reflection
What I appreciated most from this talk is how solar technology is no longer sold as a one-size-fits-all product. It now works as a personalized service. As future Electrical Engineers, we are expected to study the client’s daily energy habits before choosing the best configuration for them.

The Philippine setting also gives solar a different meaning. Before, it was marketed as a way to cut costs. Today, it is also seen as protection from frequent power interruptions. Hybrid systems, in particular, offer both savings and security. It feels promising to know that our technical training can directly improve the quality of life in many homes.

Know Your Numbers: Understanding Accounting and Financial Statements to Extend Your Subway
by Ms. Clarice Schofield

Introduction
On the same day, we attended the fourth and final webinar led by Ms. Clarice Schofield of Ernst and Young Global Consulting Services. Her talk, “Know Your Numbers,” turned the spotlight away from circuits and equipment and toward the financial skills needed to evaluate whether a project deserves to move forward.

Summary
Ms. Schofield began by reminding us that engineers help shape decisions inside a company. To do that effectively, we need to understand the basic ideas behind accounting. She introduced the four essential concepts in simple terms. Assets are the things the business owns. Liabilities are responsibilities or debts. Equity represents the owner’s stake. Revenue refers to the money earned from operations.

She also discussed several indicators that help founders track the health of a startup. Runway tells you how long your remaining funds can keep the business alive. Burn Rate shows the amount of money spent every month. The Break even point marks the moment your income finally covers all operating costs.

She encouraged us to use AI tools for data cleaning, organizing spreadsheets or preparing drafts of financial reports. However, she warned that these tools can still make errors, so engineers and managers must double check every important figure.

Learnings and Reflection
From this session, I realized that financial literacy gives engineers the ability to argue for their ideas. A design that looks impressive on paper becomes meaningless if the numbers behind it are weak. Investors and managers pay attention to costs, risks and income, so we need to learn how to speak their language. Understanding how money moves inside a project strengthens our ability to lead and to innovate.
