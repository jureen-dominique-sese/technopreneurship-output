THE PITCHER’S PRIMER: SHAPING THE ENGINEER’S MINDSET FOR INNOVATION, IMPACT, AND ENTERPRISE
Ms. Chriz Luminario & Ms. Almira Shane A. Manlapaz

Introduction
Our batch gathered at Bulwagang BUeño last November 6, 2025 for a session meant to stretch our minds beyond circuits and solenoids. The seminar, prepared by the groups of Ms. Llenaresas and Ms. Marmol, carried the title “The Pitcher’s Primer,” and centered on turning classroom ideas into ventures that could survive outside school. Two speakers led the discussion: Ms. Chriz Luminario and Ms. Almira Shane A. Manlapaz.

Summary
Ms. Luminario, who runs Lumiere Studio, opened by mapping out the new landscape of marketing. She described how promotion used to rely on print and television, but attention today lives almost entirely on phone screens. She walked us through strategies that help brands surface in this crowded digital space, from search algorithms to social media campaigns, and explained that a product’s identity begins with its purpose, not its logo. She even highlighted how humor—particularly memes—has become a tool for visibility.

Ms. Manlapaz from the DICT followed with a look at national support systems for innovators. She unpacked the Innovative Startup Act, a law designed to give local startups a fighting chance through funding and mentorship. Using familiar examples like GCash and Angkas, she illustrated how these programs nurture small ideas into solutions scaled for the public. What stuck with me most was her explanation of an ideal startup team: a Hustler who drives business growth, a Hacker who handles the technical heart of the product, and a Hipster who shapes user experience and design.

Learnings and Reflection
This session made me appreciate that even the strongest ideas need a bridge toward the public, and that bridge is digital marketing. Engineers are trained to solve technical problems, but technopreneurs also have to communicate, persuade and stand out. Learning that the government actively supports Filipino innovators was reassuring. Knowing that assistance exists makes the journey from classroom concept to functioning startup feel more possible.

THE TECHNOPRENEUR’S TOOLKIT: BUILDING MARKET-READY STARTUPS THROUGH MODELS, ANALYSIS, AND STRATEGY
Engr. Harvey S. Javier & Engr. Noli M. Esparas

Introduction
Two days later, on the afternoon of November 8, 2025, the seminar continued with a session focused on the practical side of building technology for real markets. This time, we heard from both private and public sectors. Engr. Harvey S. Javier, a CEO and software engineer, represented the world of tech companies; Engr. Noli M. Esparas Jr. of the DOST represented the institutions shaping the country’s innovation ecosystem.

Summary
Engr. Javier’s segment, titled “Innovating the Future,” pulled back the curtain on how modern digital products are assembled. Rather than speaking in abstractions, he used the work of his own companies—SparkPoint and HSJ Technologies—to explain how different tools interact. Blockchain ensures secure and transparent processes, while AI automates tasks and generates insights. He emphasized that no matter how advanced the tech stack becomes, its survival depends on how well it serves the users.

Meanwhile, Engr. Esparas offered a wider lens. His focus was on the structures that make innovation possible. He explained the DOST’s mandate as a bridge between scientific knowledge and societal benefit. He grouped their programs into support systems for businesses, assistance for innovation hubs and technology commercialization, and livelihood initiatives for communities. He also framed startup success as something that relies on a full ecosystem, involving policy, culture, talent, financial support and actual market demand.

Learnings and Reflection
This seminar left me with a clearer picture of technopreneurship as a blend of cutting-edge tools and grounded realities. Engr. Javier’s talk showed how far technology has evolved, while Engr. Esparas reminded us that every innovation stands on a network of institutions, people and policies. The idea that AI serves as an “enabler” rather than a replacement resonated deeply. Machines can optimize the build, but only people can identify the real problems worth solving.

The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Solar: Technology, Setup, and Startup
by Mr. Sony Sabdao, RME

Introduction
On November 22, our class held the third session of our webinar series on Zoom for our Technopreneurship course under Engr. Olesco. This time, our block invited Mr. Sony Sabdao, the General Manager of S-S Enterprises. His talk, titled “The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Solar,” explored how solar energy can help tackle everyday problems in many communities, especially unstable power and rising electric bills.

Summary
Mr. Sabdao opened the discussion by connecting solar science with real-world engineering work. He explained how sunlight becomes usable energy through the photovoltaic effect and how solar setups increase in scale depending on the power requirements of a household or business. He also compared grid-tie, hybrid and off-grid systems in a very practical way, showing how each one fits different lifestyles and locations.

After laying down the technical ideas, he shifted to what it actually takes to build a solar business. He highlighted the need for accurate financial calculations, proper permits, site evaluations and a clear understanding of customer needs. Solar work might sound exciting, but according to him, progress depends on careful planning. A good design only becomes valuable when it is financially sound and properly executed.

Learnings and Reflection
What I appreciated most from this talk is how solar technology is no longer sold as a one-size-fits-all product. It now works as a personalized service. As future Electrical Engineers, we are expected to study the client’s daily energy habits before choosing the best configuration for them.

The Philippine setting also gives solar a different meaning. Before, it was marketed as a way to cut costs. Today, it is also seen as protection from frequent power interruptions. Hybrid systems, in particular, offer both savings and security. It feels promising to know that our technical training can directly improve the quality of life in many homes.

Know Your Numbers: Understanding Accounting and Financial Statements to Extend Your Subway
by Ms. Clarice Schofield

Introduction
On the same day, we attended the fourth and final webinar led by Ms. Clarice Schofield of Ernst and Young Global Consulting Services. Her talk, “Know Your Numbers,” turned the spotlight away from circuits and equipment and toward the financial skills needed to evaluate whether a project deserves to move forward.

Summary
Ms. Schofield began by reminding us that engineers help shape decisions inside a company. To do that effectively, we need to understand the basic ideas behind accounting. She introduced the four essential concepts in simple terms. Assets are the things the business owns. Liabilities are responsibilities or debts. Equity represents the owner’s stake. Revenue refers to the money earned from operations.

She also discussed several indicators that help founders track the health of a startup. Runway tells you how long your remaining funds can keep the business alive. Burn Rate shows the amount of money spent every month. The Break even point marks the moment your income finally covers all operating costs.

She encouraged us to use AI tools for data cleaning, organizing spreadsheets or preparing drafts of financial reports. However, she warned that these tools can still make errors, so engineers and managers must double check every important figure.

Learnings and Reflection
From this session, I realized that financial literacy gives engineers the ability to argue for their ideas. A design that looks impressive on paper becomes meaningless if the numbers behind it are weak. Investors and managers pay attention to costs, risks and income, so we need to learn how to speak their language. Understanding how money moves inside a project strengthens our ability to lead and to innovate.

Master the Market: Navigate Smart Home Demand and Rise Above Competitors
Ms. Ayessa Nixzel Dumlao

Introduction
Later in the afternoon of November 22, our class continued the seminar series with a session led by Ms. Ayessa Nixzel Dumlao from Neovega SmartHome. Her topic pulled us out of the usual industrial setting and placed us inside the modern Filipino home. It was a tour of how smart automation is quietly reshaping everyday living.

Summary
Ms. Dumlao explained that smart homes aren’t built around individual gadgets. They’re built around connection. Lights, cameras, air conditioners, speakers and even curtains operate as one system that can be controlled through a phone or voice commands. She emphasized that the magic happens when these devices “cooperate” to improve comfort, security and energy use.

To bring this to life, she showcased real examples from her company. The automated curtains, for instance, adjust themselves depending on the time of day, helping regulate room temperature without human effort. The switchable smart film instantly transforms windows from clear to opaque, giving privacy on demand. These demonstrations showed how simple problems at home are solved through a mix of hardware and clever programming.

Learnings and Reflection
This seminar shifted my view of our profession. I realized that Electrical Engineering isn’t confined to power plants or industrial systems. It can also be personal. In the smart home world, engineers help shape the feel and rhythm of someone’s everyday life. The job isn’t only about wires or voltage; it’s about comfort, design and subtle convenience. It made me see the growing opportunities in creating home systems that adjust to the user instead of the other way around.

The Technopreneur’s Toolkit: Building Market-Ready Startups Through Models, Analysis, and Strategy
Ms. Sachie Mitsui Padillo Turiano

Introduction
To close the entire seminar series that same afternoon, our block teamed up with another group to host the final talk. We invited Ms. Marie Sachie Mitsui Turiano Academia, CEO of Fortem Auctrix, to dig into the heart of technopreneurship. Her goal was simple: teach us how understanding people and their needs is just as important as mastering the technology itself.

Summary
Ms. Academia opened by reframing what it means to be a technopreneur. It isn’t just about inventing something new. It’s about creating something that matters. Many startups collapse not because their product is weak, but because they created solutions that nobody asked for.

To help us avoid that trap, she introduced two tools. IMAP focuses on figuring out what the customer really needs by identifying the problem, mapping the users, checking the industry and spotting gaps. ARC explains how to turn an idea into a real offering by building awareness, connecting emotionally and finally convincing users to try it. She referenced well-known brands like Tesla and Apple to show how they succeed by combining technology with a deep understanding of human behavior.

Learnings and Reflection
This final session completely reframed how I see innovation. I used to believe that once the design works, the job is done. But after hearing Ms. Academia, I realized that something only becomes an innovation when it solves a real need. A perfectly built device is meaningless if no one finds it helpful.

The frameworks she shared felt like formulas for studying people instead of circuits. Just as we compute for current or power, we also need to compute for interest and relevance. It made me appreciate that engineering and entrepreneurship are not separate worlds. They meet at the point where technology becomes genuinely useful.
